This document is to help plan version 2.0 of our University Class Management.

For context, please read the README.md file to understand the work done up to today.

Suggested Improvements :

1. Improve UIs Theme to match HEC Montreal (see https://www.hec.ca/en). Colors & Logo should be used where possible to ensure that students going through it feels like it was built for HEC Montreal.

2. End User UIs. I want to offer a moderm experience for the 3 core users, Admin, Teacher and Student. I want to opt for a minimalist style, well structure to ensure students are impressed.

3. As the teacher teaching this Application Security class, I want to have a script to run to ensure all key functions we've built work (ex. Does basic login work for all the user types, A way to quickly debug issues that arise, etc.)

The overall objective would be to limit the risk of this application failing during a class.
